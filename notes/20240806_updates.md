Updates:

1) Got pipeline notebooks working using kmeans clustering from batdetect2 training data to output results in terms of activity grids from duty-cycling on kaleidoscope detections.
2) Need to revisit comparisons modules and perform duty-cycle evaluation to see if trends are similar for the assertions on kaleidoscope detections.
