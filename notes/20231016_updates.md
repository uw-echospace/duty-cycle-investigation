What I worked on today:

1) Packing up tests into scripts and making functional tests for Wu-Jung to review my code sometime soon.

Questions I left off for tomorrow:

1) How to calculate theoretical expected values for bout metrics using simulated data and check if implemented function works accordingly?
    - Need to incorporate, call duration, inter-call interval, # of calls in interval to theoretically derive bout duration given BCI.
    - Should be easy to do, just need to put together the variables
