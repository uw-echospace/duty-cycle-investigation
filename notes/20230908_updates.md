# What I did today:

## Explored ideas to cluster frequency groups using spectrum.
#### Added some notebooks pertaining to exploring the 3rd frequency group.
- The 3rd frequency group is fairly separable from the HF calls in Central Pond.
- However, for Telephone Field, they are much more alike in frequencies.
- In Telephone Field, there is also a lot of variation for all HF calls. So yellow can seem red, red can seem yellow. Or either can seem like neither.

#### Things I can do as next steps:
- Use the current thresholds I have set up to categorize calls into frequency groups.
- Calculate the BCI for calls of each frequency group to break each frequency group into bouts.
- For each bout, get the X% or X number of calls with a high enough SNR.
- For each call of that bout, what is the spectrum? Take -10dB to the left and right of the max and just plot a line.
- What is the most activated frequency or range of frequencies of this bout? 
- Classify each bout according to its most activate range of frequencies.
- These are the "true" frequency groupings.

## Plan for tomorrow:
#### Take a break and work on the Activity Index side of things:
- Let's get comparisons between LF and HF calls and locations.
- Is the activity in Telephone Field actually high or is it just the # of calls being high due to the smaller IPIs.
